A python tool for syncing files between google drive and local file-system.

NOTE: This is the development branch. No commits have been made to the main/master branch yet.

* Installation

Currently, to use this tool you have to create a project in google cloud console, configure the oAuth consent screen, get client id and client secret, authorize yourself via oAuthPlayground and get a refresh token. Then export these credentials via environment variables.

I may write a detailed blog about this in near future. However, my current priority is to implement more features.

* Usage

The =--help= option produces the following output.

#+begin_src shell
  usage: gsync.py [-h] [-r] [-c] sourcedir destinationdir

  positional arguments:
    sourcedir
    destinationdir

  options:
    -h, --help       show this help message and exit
    -r, --recursive  scan and sync files recursively
    -c, --checksum   use checksum instead of last modified time to  compare files (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

#+end_src
